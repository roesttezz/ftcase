JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the oldest yet largest financial institutions in the United States, founded by Jamie Dimon and incorporated on December 1st, 2020. In February 2019, the firm announced the creation of their own dollar-backed digital currency, called JPM Coin.

JPM Coin is a digital and fiat currency that is intended to transform payments between institutional customers through the use of blockchain technology for instantaneous settlement at the same time as smart contracts close. The idea's origin is seen as JPMorgan Chase's attempt to catch up with the technological disruption in the finance industry, even when such attempt goes against their own words of previous opposition to cryptocurrencies. JPM Coin announcement makes JPMorgan Chase the pioneer of all large financial instituations in the U.S. fintech industry to ever do anything like their coin. While its future development is yet to be seen, this attempt is seen to better ensure the company's hope in their success in capturing the reformation of the traditional finance landscape.

The company's cash flow analysis stated that their free cash flow dropped 57.38% from $14,187B in 2018 to $6,046B in 2019, in which both numbers accounted for the company's spending in operating activities, signaling the company's investment in organic development. Throughout the development of JPM Coin, the firm has been actively recruiting employees through their internship and associate program while seemingly forming partnerships with fintech infrastructure designers and engineers.





## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments

JPMorgan Chase wants to transform itself through the innovation of payments, specifically digital currency payments between institutional banks, with the hope to solve the delayed trade settlement time after every smart contract and to add further regulation and security to the new method of digital transfer.

As JPMorgan Chase clearly stated that their stance over the cryptocurrencies remains supportive as long as proper regulations and control are implemented, their new digital currency also strived its best to meet such expectations. Specifically, JPM Coin is believed to solve 4 main concerns while benefiting the customers, as retrieved from their digital coin payments website:

> 1. **Strong Balance Sheet** of $2.6 trillion ensures stability and fiat
> 2. **Security & Innovation** upheld by millions of dollars on cybersecurity each year and a Blockchain Center of Excellence
> 3. **Strong Controls & Compliance** through AML and KYC controls
> 4. **Regulatory Oversight** through the compliance with banking laws and regulations and supervision of baking regulators and international jurisdictions





### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The intended customers are now limited to institutional customers, meaning that the current deployment of JPM Coin is private and internal and a mass introduction to the public or individual customers stays out of the firm's plan.

Because of JP Morgan's position as one of the largest banks in the world, JPM Coin can cover a huge market capitalization of stablecoin that may make the firm "*largest stablecoin issuer on a blockchain*" with just one small and limited issuance.

The current stablecoin market size falls around $2.7B, meaning that 0.1% of JP Morgan Chase's balance sheet of $2.6T would make up aroughly 96% of the current market size.





### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/jpmcoin

The nature of an incumbent financial institution makes up most of JPM Coin's advantage that its competitors may have little to no chance to compete as JPMorgan Chase may decide to expand their market to include individual customers.

Considering a larger market of stable-coin, JPM Coin may hold a competitive position. As soon as JPM Coin decides to outreach the public market, its mass customer base with incredibly strong balance sheet would have the power to outweigh many of the existing competitors. It is undeniable that its readily available resources of capital, cybersecurity, customer base, and established reputation give the firm a great competitive edge in the stable-coin market.

When take a look into the niche market they are pursuing, there may be less to say about their advantages. JPMorgan Chase is obviously a large bank but it is also obvious that as soon as other large financial institutions step in the game, JPMorgan Chase may see their advantage losing its power repidly. Those new challengers can directly compete with JPMorgan Chase regarding capital resources, balance sheet, cybersecurity, and customer base. When this happens, their leverage of being either an pioneer or a huge bank will soon fail to help them thrive amid the competitiveness and increasing innovation from others.





### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Enterprise features are integrated into the Quorum architecture to perform and meet the fore-mentioned requirements in business operation. The Quorum architecture includes elements that are designed to specifically support the enterprise's need, including:

1. **Quorum Node**
Quorum nodes used in JPM Coin are forks (*blockchain network's splits*) of geth ("*a Go Programming Language implementation of Ethereum blockchain Geth*). Quorum nodes are continuously improved with inline updates while having its features modified to match enterprise clients' needs such as changes to block validation logic to handle 'Private Transactions'.

2. **Privacy Manager**
Privacy Manager or Private Transaction Manager allow the nodes to share transaction information securely between authorized parties within a transaction. Privay Manager is made up of transaction manager and enclave.
* **Transaction Manager**: JPM Coin's transaction's manager is Tessera, a Java system that can be used and deloyed easily by businesses to encrypt, decrypt, and distribute confidential transactions for Quorum.
* **Enclave**: Distributed Ledger protocols that can be used for transaction confidentiality, participant authentication, and data preservation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
---




### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

While offering the JPM Coin exclusively to the institutional customers can be a great start, JPMorgan Chase, at some points, will face the need to introduce a product that is designed to serve the mass public and individual customers before their competitors take up all the market capitalization in the retail investors market.

JPMorgan Chase must keep in mind that any other financial institutions of their size and reputation can do whatever they are doing and the only way to tackle that challenge is to continuously innovate and disrupt their technology and services.

Additionally, fintech industry is a new industry that is made up of the 2 long-known fields of finance and technology. If possible, JPMorgan Chase should be looking for that kind of treasure that everyone else is missing, the hidden gem that lies in the future of fintech that is unique, is revolutionary, and is the only one of their kind.




### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The company is trying to create a financial ecosystem that is developed under the name of Morgan Chase. As the company is one of the biggest in its industry, it obviously has the resources to build and to boost its product into such system to become the apple of the finance industry.

While it may benefit the company as JPM Coin is kept solely for circulation within the U.S., it may take more time and greater adaptation for the coin to integrate into the global financial system. No success comes in the first day but as JPMorgan Chase knows how to leverage their profounding advantages, JPM Coin will thrive.



### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

AML and KYC have been stated as one of the thing that JPMorgan Chase hopes to further address in the introduction of JPM Coin. Biological identification like what the new generation smartphones are doing, in combination with the digital coin, can supplement each other in the battle agaisnt fraud and financial crimes.


### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
